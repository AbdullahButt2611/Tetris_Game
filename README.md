### Features
<br>
Following are some of the new features and learning encountered while creating this amazing project:

- <b>Randomly generated tiles:</b><br> The game generates random tiles of different shapes and sizes, and the player has to use the arrow keys to move and arrange them to fill up the empty spaces.

- <b>Arrow keys control:</b><br> The arrow keys allow the player to move the tiles left or right and to rotate them. The up arrow key is used to rotate the tiles, while the left and right arrow keys are used to move them in the corresponding direction.

- <b>W key for tile arrangement:</b><br> The user can press the W key to change the arrangement of the tiles in a way that they fit in the empty spaces perfectly.

- <b>Levels and score:</b><br> The game has multiple levels, and as the player progresses through the levels, the game becomes more challenging. The score is displayed on the screen, and it increases as the player fills up the empty spaces with tiles.

- <b>User-friendly interface:</b><br> The game has a simple, easy-to-navigate interface that is intuitive and user-friendly.

- <b>Responsive design:</b><br> The game is designed to work on both desktop and mobile devices and has a responsive design that adjusts to the size of the screen.

- <b>Browser compatibility:</b><br> The game is compatible with most modern web browsers and does not require any additional plugins or software to run.
